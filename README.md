Project *kimeru-chan* is a brainstorming productivity app primarily designed in React.

![OHHH YEAH](https://github.com/starrodkirby86/kimeru-chan/raw/master/src/res/oh_yeah.gif)

## Cloning the Project
Use your favorite terminal and use the following command. (Be sure that git is installed!)

``git clone https://github.com/starrodkirby86/kimeru-chan``

From there, installation and running is like your typical Create-React-App boilerplate.
In other words, simply run ``npm install`` or ``yarn install``, then ``npm start``.
